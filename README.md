<b>Overview of Project:</b><br>
DMR Capital was built to allow users to utilize machine learning systems (Support Vector Machine and Recurrent Neural Net), sentiment analysis and basic stock data and indicators to make informed trading decisions to generate above average market return.

<b>Technology Details:</b><br>
When starting the project, I knew I wanted to explore the relationship between machine learning and predicitive modeling as they are a natural fit.  I was intrigued with deep learning to see if the results might be enhanced by having both something with back propagation.  I had read about the success that classifiers had with data such as the stock market so that was the first avenue I decided to persue.  I was deciding between logistic regression, decision trees and SVM.  Logistic regression would certainly be easier to scale and build but it's simplicity seemed to also be a hinderance in something as complex as the stock market.  Creating a decision boundry and making classifications would imo lead to weak correlation.  Decision trees were the next logical step but although it was capable of handling more complexity I was afraid of running the risk of overfitting and its strong bias which may yield good results in training but fail in testing.  I ended up going with SVMs because considering the large number of features and number of observations it would be a bit more accurate in this case and not overly bias towards the training data.  Next I decided I wanted to test out how well a neural network could compete with a classifier and I decided to go with the RNN.  My reasoning was RNNs typically handle time series and sequential data which the stock market is based on.  In this sense the RNN has some internal memory of what it saw previously. It uses that memory to decide how exactly it should operate on the next input. Thus an RNN remembers within the scope and for predictive modeling especially the stock market where momentum weighs heavily it would be essential to treat events as related and not just forget.  <br>
I also wanted to add sentiment analysis as sentiment is one of the most difficult things to measure in the market.  It can play a huge role in stock movement but it largely hard to pinpoint.  I started using twitter as a medium for voices on the market to be heard and analyzed.  Using twitter's api and textblob, I was able to parse through an indivdual companies stock mentions and look at each stocks polarity and subjectivity.  By having these features, I attempted to categorize whether a response was positive or negative towards the equity and present this to the user.
